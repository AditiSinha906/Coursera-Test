	Before we start things here are 
	<a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/before-you-start/application-tips">some application tips:</a>
	<br>
	<u>Event Basic Rules:</u>
	<ul>
		<li class="p">TEDx talk format:</li>
			<br>Modeled after the TED format, TEDx events consist of a series of short, carefully prepared talks, demonstrations, and performances on a wide range of subjects.<br>
			TEDx talks should be less than 18 minutes long and are typically delivered by a single presenter. <br>
			No panels or audience Q&A are permitted.<br>
			Breakouts and workshops are permitted at TEDx events, but must be held outside of stage sessions.<br>

		<li class="p">Spirit and purpose:</li>

			<br>Your event must maintain the spirit of TED events: multidisciplinary, focused on the power of ideas to change lives and ultimately, the world. TEDx events are not agenda or single-topic driven.<br>

		<li class="p">Multi-topical and multidisciplinary:</li>
			<br>TEDx event themes should be multidisciplinary and broad. TEDx events must feature a diversity of speakers from across several disciplines that address a variety of topics. These topics should not fall under a single subject.<br>

		<li class="p">Duration:</li>
			<br>Your event may not exceed one day in length, unless otherwise noted for your event type. Check the event type page for details on your event type.<br>

		<li class="p">Introduction video:</li>
			<br>The official TEDx introduction video must be played at the beginning of your event so that the audience understands TEDx and the difference between TED and TEDx.<br>

		<li class="p">Broadcasting your event:</li>
			<br>You may organize a watch party in a separate venue for up to 100 people. Only events that are licensed to host more than 100 people may have more than 100 people at their watch parties.
			<br>Watch parties may charge a fee of up to 50% of the event’s ticket cost.
			<br>You may have a simulcast lounge in the same venue as your main event, but the total amount of attendees in one venue cannot exceed 100 people if your event is not licensed to host over 100 attendees.<br>
		<li class="p">Attendance:</li>
			<br>Up to 100 individuals may attend your event.
			<br>
